# 3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering

I adding extra comments on top of original 3D Gaussian Splatting repository for the better understanding on the logic or connection between the files. I'm still at the beginning stage of the work, but if anyone wants to contribute to improving interpretability of the 3DGS repository, please feel free to make a pull request!
